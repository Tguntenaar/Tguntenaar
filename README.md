## Hi there! How are you doing? ðŸ‘‹

I'm a tech enthusiast and full-stack developer. Whether you're interested in discussing the latest tech trends or exploring potential collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out! I'm always eager to connect and learn from others.

Here's a glimpse into what I have been up to lately:

- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm developing Near Social's [DevHub](https://near.org/devhub.near/widget/app) platform and supporting Near's ecosystem.
- ðŸŒ± We are working with React components stored on chain, smart contracts written in Rust and indexers for data accesibility.
- ðŸ‘¯ With my two brothers, Boris and Olivier, we're exploring opportunities in Computer Vision, 3D models and drones technology. Checkout [Zero Gravity](https://zgdrone.com/en/) and [Powerspect Pro](https://www.powerspect.pro/)
- âš¡ Last but not least I'm building a launchpad for the blockchain CoreDao in Nextjs called [FullForce](https://www.fullforce.io)

Outside of coding, I'm into skydiving and almost all other sports, currently following jiu jitsu classes at 10th planet.
