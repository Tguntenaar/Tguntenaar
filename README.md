## Hey there! How's everything going? ðŸ‘‹

I'm a tech enthusiast and full-stack native developer specializing in React Native and Near applications. Whether you're interested in discussing the latest tech trends or exploring potential collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out! I'm always eager to connect and learn from others.

You can easily get in touch with me via email ðŸ“«, and we can explore alternative communication methods if necessary ðŸ’¬.

Outside of coding, I'm passionate about space exploration, skydiving, and other adrenaline-pumping sports. Plus, I'm currently delving into the world of kickboxing to stay active and energized.

If you're involved in running a lightning node âš¡ and looking to expand your network, don't hesitate to give me a shout!

Here's a glimpse into what I'm up to lately:

- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm immersed in the development of Near Social's DevHub platform and Near's ecosystem.
- ðŸŒ± I'm also diving into Rust to broaden my skill set.
- âš¡ Last but not least I'm building a launchpad for the blockchain CoreDao in Nextjs called [FullForce](fullforce.io)
