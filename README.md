## Hi there! How are you doing? ðŸ‘‹

I'm a tech enthusiast and full-stack native developer specializing in React Native and Near applications. Whether you're interested in discussing the latest tech trends or exploring potential collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out! I'm always eager to connect and learn from others.

Here's a glimpse into what I have been up to lately:

- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm developing Near Social's [DevHub](https://near.org/devhub.near/widget/app) platform and supporting Near's ecosystem.
- ðŸŒ± We are working with React / Rust smart contracts and indexer to build this
- ðŸ‘¯ With my two brothers I'm exploring opportunities in Computer Vision, 3D models and drones. Checkout [Zero Gravity](https://zgdrone.com/en/) and [Powerspect Pro](https://www.powerspect.pro/)
- âš¡ Last but not least I'm building a launchpad for the blockchain CoreDao in Nextjs called [FullForce](https://www.fullforce.io)

Outside of coding, I'm passionate about skydiving, and other extreme sports.
